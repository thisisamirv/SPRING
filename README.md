SPRING2 is a compressor for FASTQ and FASTA sequencing data, including paired-end data and gzipped FASTQ inputs. It is built on top of the original **[SPRING](https://github.com/shubhamchandak94/SPRING)** project and represents a substantial modernization of that codebase.

> [!TIP]
> This revision substantially modernizes the original SPRING codebase. It upgrades the build system to C++20 and CMake 4.2, removes the remaining Boost dependency, adds first-class cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and native Windows builds, and expands the runtime to cover grouped lane archives, assay-aware compression behavior, preview and audit workflows, richer gzip metadata preservation, and cleaner developer and benchmarking tooling.

## Features

- Near-optimal compression for single-end, paired-end, and grouped multi-lane sequencing datasets
- Lossless preservation of reads, quality scores, and identifiers, with reversible assay-aware transforms where applicable
- Optional lossy quality compression using [QVZ](https://github.com/mikelhernaez/qvz/), [Illumina 8-level binning](https://www.illumina.com/documents/products/whitepapers/whitepaper_datacompression.pdf), or binary thresholding
- Automatic FASTQ versus FASTA detection, plain-text versus gzipped input handling, and gzip-aware output restoration
- Support for grouped archives with `R1`/`R2` plus optional `R3`, `I1`, and `I2` lanes
- Automatic and explicit assay handling for `dna`, `rna`, `atac`, `bisulfite`, `sc-rna`, `sc-atac`, and `sc-bisulfite`
- Preview mode for archive inspection and audit mode for dry-run integrity verification without full decompression
- Record-level CRC32 verification for lossless archives during decompression and optional post-compression auditing
- Cross-platform builds and CI coverage for Linux, macOS, and native Windows toolchains
- Free for non-profit research and educational use

## Platform Support

SPRING2 is built and validated on:

- **Linux**: x86_64, ARM64
- **macOS**: Universal (Intel/Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: Native via MinGW-w64, Native ARM64 via MSVC

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

The easiest way to use SPRING2 is to download the pre-built binaries from the **[Releases](https://github.com/thisisamirv/SPRING/releases)** page.

## Running SPRING

Current command-line help:

```text
Allowed options:

* General Options:
  -h [ --help ]                   produce help message
  -V [ --version ]                produce version information
  -o [ --output ] arg             output file name
                                    - if not specified, it uses original input
                                      filenames (swapping extension to .sp during
                                      compression)
                                    - for paired end decompression, if only one file
                                      is specified, two output files will be created
                                      by suffixing .1 and .2
  -t [ --threads ] arg            number of threads (default:
                                  min(max(1, hw_threads - 1), 16))
  -m [ --memory ] arg (=0)        approximate memory budget in GB; reduces
                                  effective thread count using about 1 GB per
                                  worker thread (0 disables)
  -v [ --verbose ]                enable extensive logging (default: progress bar)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Compression Options:
  -c [ --compress ]               compress
  -R1 [ --R1 ] arg                input read-1 file (required)
  -R2 [ --R2 ] arg                input read-2 file (optional; enables paired-end mode)
  -R3 [ --R3 ] arg                input read-3 file (optional; requires --R2)
  -I1 [ --I1 ] arg                input index-read-1 file (optional; requires --R2)
  -I2 [ --I2 ] arg                input index-read-2 file (optional; requires --I1)
  -l [ --level ] arg (=6)         compression level (1-9) to use for output
                                  (.gz) formatting (passed to gzip unchanged
                                  and scaled to Zstd 1-22 internally)
  -s [ --strip ] arg              discard data: i (ids), o (order), q (quality)
                                  Example: --strip io to drop ids and order.
  -q [ --qmod ] arg               quality mode: possible modes are
                                    1. -q lossless (default)
                                    2. -q qvz qv_ratio (QVZ lossy compression,
                                      parameter qv_ratio roughly corresponds to
                                      bits used per quality value)
                                    3. -q ill_bin (Illumina 8-level binning)
                                    4. -q binary thr high low (binary (2-level)
                                      thresholding, quality binned to high if >=
                                      thr and to low if < thr)
  -n [ --note ] arg               add a custom note to the archive
  -y [ --assay ] arg (=auto)      specify assay type. Valid choices:
                                  auto, dna, rna, atac, bisulfite,
                                  sc-rna, sc-atac, sc-bisulfite
  -a [ --audit ]                  enable post-operation integrity verification
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Decompression Options:
  -d [ --decompress ]             decompress
  -i [ --input ] arg              input archive file (.sp)
  -u [ --unzip ]                  during decompression, force output to be
                                  uncompressed (even if original was .gz)

When an archive was created with grouped lanes (`--R3` and/or `--I1/--I2`),
decompression with a single `-o <prefix>` emits grouped outputs using suffixes
`.R1`, `.R2`, optional `.R3`, optional `.I1`, and optional `.I2`.
```

## Previewing Archives

You can use `spring2 --preview` to quickly inspect archive metadata, original filenames, and custom notes. It also provides a high-speed **Audit** mode to verify archive integrity without full decompression:

```bash
# Display metadata preview
spring2 --preview archive.sp

# Perform a high-speed integrity audit (dry-run)
spring2 --preview --audit archive.sp
```

```text
